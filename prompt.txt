    "unit_measurement (unit of measure, e.g. pcs, kg, cones), "
    "price (unit price as a plain numeric string), "

    "line_amount (total amount for the line as numeric string), "
    "requested_date (delivery date requested by customer, normalized to YYYY‑MM‑DD), "

    "If any field is missing in a row, set its value to an empty string. "
